During my research I discovered, that it was rather impossible to gather the details without paying for the service.
"https://tradingeconomics.com/" offers the possibility to collect a two weeks timeframe of announcement effects.
The first announcements occur around March/April 2012, however, I just collected data from the beginning of the year to "complete" the year.

Free to use.
